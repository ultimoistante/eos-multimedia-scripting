eos-multimedia-scripting
========================

EOS Multimedia Scripting is an environment which uses free, cross-platform and state-of-the-art technologies helping people to develop powerful and media intensive multimedia applications, using the powerful and easy to learn Lua scripting language. EOS was born to develop cross-platform and high performance videogames.

EOS Multimedia Scripting is basically a C++/Lua environment. Kernel and core modules are developed in C++ code,
and exposes functionalities to the Lua runtime. The code of the final application, so, is done in Lua scripting.
The entire environment was born with extensibility in mind, so is pretty straightforward to add new features: simply
write a "module" (in C++), and voil√†! You have new functionalities callable from the Lua runtime.


This project is currently in an unconsistent state, so we are searching people interested in further development,
in order to make it a really great project :)
